Instagram Preview: As Marketing Chair for Ascend, a premier business organization at the University of Southern California, I created this webpage to allow my team and I to easily visualize our feed and make adjustments to creatives. This year, our team's goal is to maintain consistency and professionalism across color schemes, logo, and other elements in our design. Since we are each tasked different posts, this preview ensures we stay on the same page and work together to create a cohesive social media presence.

Reflection: I am still working on creating a more responsive program where I can upload a new image file and have the existing pictures shift down, similar to how Instagram would behave. As of now, the order or placement of the posts will not be completely accurate. However, it still allows us to visualize the bigger picture.
